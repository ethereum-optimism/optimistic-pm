# OP-Stack Project Management Repository

This repository is used for project management of various development initiatives affecting the OP-Stack.

This repository is inspired by [`ethereum/pm`](https://github.com/ethereum/pm),
but adapted for OP-Stack development needs.

It is also used for Breakout Rooms on various platform and protocol-related topics,
whose agendas can be found under the Issues page.

This repository is a collection of development notes, not a specification.
Specification work is developed and maintained
in [the specifications repository](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/specs/).
