### Karl

- Proto put together a great specs overview
- Did a bunch of jamming on the dispute game, trying to figure out where the single step + game live

### Ben

- Option 3 in the notion doc that Andrew put together seems like the best solution
- Andrew is now working under the assumption that the final state transition is a pure function, it does not have any reference to prior state

### Proto

- [Overview document in the specs repo](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimistic-specs/blob/main/overview.md)
    - Need spec out the API for retrieving the proofs
    - Need a spec on how to run the fraud proof generator
- Fraud proof generator
    - One test case that runs basic opcodes
    - It doesn't do calls yet and doesn't touch storage yet
    - Has implemented most PMT changes
    - Binary trees with all the contents, ssz types, whenever you change the data it wraps the datastructure and will look at the nodes that are touched and automatically create witnesses
- Specs take a very long time
- How do we use the executor?
    - Do we use the merge API?
- Witness format needs to be documented

### Matt

- Thinking about how and where to validate deposits in the rollup blocks

### Ansgar

- Still figuring out his role here, rough understanding of some of the problems
- Spoke with Andrew about the challenge game, the first step of the fraud prove
- Has some thoughts about liveliness around it
    - Every step has branching, the sequencer needs to be alive during the process

### London Node Progress

- Kelvin has been exploring migrating our current diff to London
- Minimizing the diff before migrating, doing a fresh geth instead of trying to migrate
- What is the right way vs the iterative way?
    - Big open questions:
        - How to deal with deposits?
        - How to deal with `L1TxOrigin` ?
            - It is used in deposit smart contracts
- The important thing to track is the what contract send the tx from L1 to L2
- The deposit contract could have infinite ETH and it could transfer to an account - this would be most minimal diff to geth
- Outside of geth, you are limited in validation

### Fraud Proof Generator

- Trying to be very minimal, nothing fancy in python
- How to translate it to solidity
- The generator is the same thing as the verifier
- The solidity needs to be less dynamic than the python
- What will the process look like?
    - **ssz gives a lot of determinism**
    - **Need solidity libraries to parse the data structures**
        - Needs specialized libraries for parsing ssz into exact data structures required to operate with in solidity

### Merge API

- Felix on ACD will give a presentation tomorrow on how he thinks it will work
- Its relatively stable, possible that some changes will happen
- In one month, the client teams are getting together for working together on a prototype
- It sounds like using this is not the next regenesis but the next regenesis after that

### Challenge Game

- You don't want the person committing fraud to get some of their money back, ie challenging yourself
- How do you handle frontrunning?
    - Use flashbots?
- It is griefable
    - Need people to manually go in and play it out

### DTL 2.0

- Conner is making great progress

### Execution engine

- If we can use the merge API then we can plug in with any client
- The rollup node should be considered dump, if we can translate system messages into a more ethereum native thing then we can utilize the merge API the most

### Mempool

- How do deposits get validated?
