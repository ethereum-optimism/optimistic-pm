### Proto

- Continuing development on the macula repo, still exploratory
- There are some problems, need a statedb interface to be able to work with
- Things in the EVM are not meant to operate on constant size, need to break things down into smaller steps
- Arbitrum invented their own storage model that works well, the idea would be to get 1:1 with the existing EVM
- The state management is the most challenging part
- Code is not merklized, need to ensure that the code matches the account code hash
- If you don't have the code in your memory yet, you need to trust the code and then compare it in a step. Code size is the bottleneck in the interactive verification
- `CALL` to an account, can read the hash from the storage trie, then need to verify it against the full bytecode, cannot just trust the code, hashing the code to get the code hash can be a large step and each step is supposed to be very small to make the cost to do a step is very small
    - hashing 10s of kbs can be much more expensive compared to other steps
- The witness includes: the last step, the current step that is merklized via a binary tree, any PMT storage + their witnesses and mappings of codehashes + bytecode
- Gas counting is part of the execution trace, it is all part of the interpreter loop
- The L2 is limited to the L1 in terms of execution when it comes to a non interactive fraud proof, that goes away with an interactive fraud proof
- Working on the Python spec, the prototype is not complete

### Lightclient

- One valuable thing to bring in would be a commitment to all state accesses, would save the need to do a binary lookup in the proof
- The proposer would commit to the order of accesses
- Can't fully get 1:1 with geth, will need to commit to intermediate states
- The commitment to state access would need to be checked against during the fraud proof
- There is state transition logic as well as VM logic, ie pay `COINBASE`
- ETK optimistic rollup - really wants to see non interactive fraud proofs, there are benefits of interactive fraud proofs
- For a long time has thought its possible to implement a very efficient interpreter
- Lets have L2s that are very good at L2s, apparently they just want to deploy everything with 1 button, thought people would be interested in writing L2 specific logic
- Wants to write an interpreter that is optimized for the fraud proof, needs exact control over what the stack looks like
- The assembler was far enough along to start working on an optimistic rollup
- Has done napkin math on how much an interpreter in low level evm would do, thinks he can optimize it more
- It could allow for state heavy operations to happen
- Dealing with dynamic size is more difficult
- Memory is difficult to deal with, it grows as execution happens, dealing with an unbounded number of logs would really grow the memory size, same with deploying contracts, keeping track of evm call frames takes more and more memory
- Would need to bound certain things, like contract size
- Need to know up front how memory will expand over time during execution
- Optimistic that it can be done, has lots of ideas that he wants to try, its a big r&d project, interactive proofs are a lot closer to production
- Thinks there is an upper bound at per transaction gas for non interactive proofs, maybe ~2 million
    - Maybe could get it higher?
- Non interactive maxi

### Andrew

- The multistep game doesn't seem that difficult based on assumptions
- Start with a state and go to the next state
- There is a sequence of machine states that lead to the final state
- All you need to do is commit to a hash at a particular step, compare hashes until there is a mismatch
    - Proto: want to do it over a merkle tree instead of it being a list of hashes, you want to be able to trust all of the previous steps, this can be done with a merkle tree instead of just the values on the border
    - Karl: the explicit reason why is?
    - Proto: because any of the previous steps may be required, can use any of the previous steps, limits access to the previous step to make things cleaner
    - Proto: a bisection, start at the top, if they differ, then split it up to 2, if they differ keep splitting until you can find the exact step that differs, can better optimize because you don't need to maintain all information in previous steps, can just reference things from previous steps
    - Proto: this is helpful during a `REVERT` - can reference things from previous steps that have been merklized instead of having to keep track of all of that information
    - Andrew: Feels like there is something he is missing
    - Proto: You use the previous step and the next step, where the next step is the fraudulent step, the representation of the evm becomes a lot more flat and cleaner
    - Karl: Can you embed the previous step into the current step?
    - Proto: yes you can, but I don't want to overcomplicate things, I guess it works but it feels a bit less clean
    - Proto: If you are able to prove from any previous step to the current step then it should be plenty of data for a fraud proof
    - Andrew: Maybe what I'm missing is the structure of the things that you are committing to
    - Proto: can abstract the leaves to be bytes32, the sequencer makes a claim that this is the top node, the verifier sees a different top node, they compare and expand the tree recursively until they find the step that is mismatched
    - Andrew: What can I read?
    - Proto: Arbitrum documents this with a few examples, they do not show any code or link to it so you need to read through the lines a bit

### Karl

- Hashing the very large contracts can fit gas-wise in a block so it should be fine
- Q: the thing that seems the hardest to get to a constant size step, the precompiles - they would be annoying to reimplement
    - Proto: Depends on the input size, can possibly get away with using the actual precompile, can also limit to reasonable sized inputs
    - Lightclient: some of them have limits and some of them do not when it comes to input size
- Two schemes, one where there is a bond that commits to all execution traces, another where a bond must be posted for each step of the execution trace
